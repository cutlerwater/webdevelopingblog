        <p>Back when the world wide web first came out, hardly any one knew how to develop web pages.  Most people probably never heard of HTML, let alone knew what it was for.  CSS, JavaScript, and other more modern technologies weren't even a thought yet.  So much has changed and most of it is for the better but not all.</p>
        <p>Today, web developers are everywhere.  We are now onto HTML version 5, CSS version 3, we have an incredible amount of JavaScript frameworks and libraries at our disposal.  Python, Ruby, C# and other languages can be used to create very dynamic web sites.  Whereas 20-30 years ago, most web sites were static.</p>
        <p>The web sites have improved dramatically and they will continue to do so.  The learning foundation is very present and you can learn how to build a lot of things just by watching some YouTube tutorial videos and the web development is massive and spread out all over the world.</p>
        <p>I've always found it interesting that to this day, unless I'm missing something or am totally ignorant, all web development languages are written in English, which to me means in order to learn web development, you need to be proficient in English.  I don't of any web technologies that require me to know any other language, at least not yet.</p>
        <p>The only negatives I have found in web development so far are that it's almost impossible to keep up.  The amount of JavaScript libraries alone are overwhelming and just as I think I've heard about all of them, I find out about five more.  And that's just JavaScript.  The amount of text editors available are amazing.</p>
        <p>And finally, because there are so many other web developers out there now, while it is overall a big plus, it's also a big negative because it seems like all the good ideas have already been tried.  It's hard to stand out. But overall, I love learning and trying new stuff and amazing myself as well as others.</p>
